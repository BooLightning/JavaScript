  function init(e) {
    alert('We have already seen the different types of events: click, dblclick, load, mouseover, mouseout, etc. HTML attributes used to call these events all begin with “on”, but when referencing the event type directly, you do not include the “on” prefix. For example, the following code shows how to call the init() function when the load event of the window object occurs:');
  }
  window.addEventListener('load', init);

<title>window load</title>

<body>
<main>
  <p>Run this in the browser and you will see the “Hello, world!” alert as soon as the page
   is finished loading.<br><br>

Notice in the code above that init is passed to addEventListener() without the usual trailing<br>
 parentheses associated with functions. It is window.addEventListener('load', init); and not<br>
 window.addEventListener('load', init() ); The reason is that we are not calling the function <br>
 at this point in the code. Rather, we are indicating that we want the function to be called <br>
 when the relevant event occurs. If you make the mistake of including the parentheses, the <br>
 function will be called immediately and the value returned from the function will be used <br>
 as the callback function, probably resulting in an error.</p>
